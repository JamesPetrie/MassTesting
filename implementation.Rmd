Goal to build a (relatively) low cost system that enables most of a population to test at a specified frequency.

   1. Sample collection sites easily available – unstaffed, in style of self-checkout kiosks with a cheap camera to discourage misuse (with option of testing at home for those with accessibility issues or symptoms)
   2. Gargle or saliva-based sampling, with detachable QR code to get test results later
   3. Scalable service like Uber or Amazon delivery frequently picks up samples
   4. Highly automated labs perform PCR tests
   5. Results posted to public database linked to QR codes (ideally within 8 hours of collection)
   6. QR code demonstrating a recent negative test permits entry into public spaces (if anonymous need test processed, if linked to identity allows entry immediately)
   7. People who test positive are required by law to effectively isolate – wage replacement, accommodation, food and transportation provided if needed

The robustness of a mass-testing intervention increases with the ability to detect, diagnose, and adapt to failure modes.
In this case, some important areas to monitor are isolation effectiveness, testing adherence, and the frequency of transmissions occurring before testing positive.
