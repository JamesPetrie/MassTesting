of the population participating (e.g. Slovakia testing the whole population twice, but not on

                factor preventing more widespread deployment. The limited scope of deployment limited
                the possible success because people testing regularly could still be infected by members of
                the broader community, and cases could rebound after time-limited interventions.
                
                For the original COVID-19 variant, Elbanna and Goldenfeld estimated that testing twice a week would be sufficient to bring Rt below 1 (assuming perfect isolation of those who test positive)
                
                Mass testing seems to be an important component of China‚Äôs ‚Äúdynamic Covid-zero‚Äù
policy (as of July 2022). The independent effect of mass testing is difficult to estimate
                because they are using it in combination with a few other strategies like venue based trac-
                ing and localized lockdowns. The combined approach seems to be effective at containing
                outbreaks, but it is difficult to determine what the cost of this is
